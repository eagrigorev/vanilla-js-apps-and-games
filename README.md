## Vanilla JavaScript Apps and Games

### The Quiz App

That app is based on two small JavaScript files: one with all the mechanics and another with quiz questions; both files are linked into an HTML page which serves as an app starter. The user has options to answer or take money at every quiz stage. The app checks users’ answers according to the quiz questions database and built-in rules of answer expectations: the app can process all the incorrect inputs and say what’s wrong.

### The Snake App

This was the most complex thing that we wrote during the first months of education. In this game, you control a small snake that moves on a field built with HTML and CSS and eats food. From time to time, poisoned food is also spawning. The more good food you eat, the longer your snake becomes. Users can lose if they hit the snake tail, walls or eat poisoned food.

### The Gallery App

That app is a small neat tool that users can build into any other website or app. It is a lightweight carousel photo gallery with images preview and a large expandable section for the full view. Users can easily tweak the app for more images or images with other aspect ratios. In the current version, the gallery app supports square pictures set in a three-column grid.
